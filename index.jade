            | Tackle Impossible is a project for Anheuser-Busch's campaign against drunk driving.  Within this React.js build, I built out components for the client-facing app and admin pages. I also created routes to register users and save their projects within the project's Mongo DB database.

            | To promote Nike's new Tech Knit line of clothing, I helped build an interactice site which displays meta-data information about two individuals' day wearing the clothing.  For the site, I used D3.js to visualize heart-rate information. I also developed an algorithm which translates temperature into an interactive color gradient.
